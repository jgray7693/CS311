To trace a path from one node to another using DFS  
Keep track of previous node in any path  
Can alter DFS algorithm to keep track of previous Vertex  
when you push new vertices to the stack, update previous to be currentV   
(fuck around with it to make sure it works properly, might fail for adjecent vertices to starting vertex)  

Breadth First Search runtime O (|V| + |E|)  
Depth First Search runtime O (|V| + |E|)  
Cycle Check runtime O (|V| + |E|)  
Dijkstra's Algorithm - Represents shortest distance between vertices assuming no negative edges  
    Runtime  
    Using a Min Heap - O((|V| + |E|)log|V|)  
    Using an Array - O(|V| * |V|)  
Bellman-Fords Algorithm - Represents shortest distance between vertices with no negative edge weight cycles  
    Runtime  
Topological Sort - Directed edges, all vertices where X points to Y, X comes before Y in the path  
    Runtime  
Minimum Spanning Tree - Subset of the graphs edges that connect all vertices with the minimum sum edge weights  
    Runtime
