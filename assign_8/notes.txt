To trace a path from one node to another using DFS  
Keep track of previous node in any path  
Can alter DFS algorithm to keep track of previous Vertex  
when you push new vertices to the stack, update previous to be currentV   
(fuck around with it to make sure it works properly, might fail for adjecent vertices to starting vertex)  

Breadth First Search runtime O(|V| + |E|)  
Depth First Search runtime (O|V| + |E|)  
Cycle Check runtime (O|V| + |E|)
